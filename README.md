# GeCO

Generators for Combinatorial Optimization

## Installation

The code heavily depends on the python interface of SCIP: [PySCIPOpt](https://github.com/scipopt/PySCIPOpt). The easiest
way to install it is using conda

```bash
conda install -c scipopt pyscipopt
```

This just might not result in the most up-to-date version, another way is installing the SCIP solver and the pip package
of `pyscipopt` following [this](https://github.com/scipopt/PySCIPOpt/blob/master/INSTALL.md) guide.

Then, once you have `pyscipopt` installed, you are ready to install the `geco` package.

```bash
pip install geco
```

That's it, now you are ready to generate some instances!

## Example

Assume you want a knapsack instance like in the Yang et
al. [paper](http://www.optimization-online.org/DB_HTML/2020/02/7626.html).

You start by looking through the knapsack package, then searching for a file with the name `FIRSTAUTHOR.py`. 
In this case we find a [`yang.py`](geco/mips/knapsack/yang.py) file in the `mips/knapsack` package.

To generate an instance with 5 items you would run

```python3
from geco import knapsack

knapsack.yang_instance(n=5, seed=1)
```

This, as all generators inside the `mips` subpackage, return a `PySCIPOpt` model that makes use of the SCIP mixed
integer programming solver, refer to their docs to learn how to set params, solve the instance and a lot more.

### Randomization

As you might have noticed the generator function has a seed parameter, as a matter of fact this is common through out
all generators that exhibit random behavior, it is used to preserve the random state, in order to get a random instance
each time you can use `seed=None`.

### Multiple instance generation

In case you want to generate more than one instance, we have created some helpful generator functions in
the [`generator.py`](geco/generator.py).

To generate n instances you can use the `generate_n` function, an example to generate 10 Yang knapsack instances would
be

```python3
from geco.generator import generate_n
from geco.mips.knapsack import yang

for model in generate_n(lambda seed: yang.yang_instance(n=5, seed=seed), n=10):
    model.optimize()
```

There is also another function `generate` which is more flexible, assuming you don't know exactly how many instance you
might require, it works the exact same way it just doesn't stop after `n` instances are generated.

### MIPLIB

[MIPLIB](https://miplib.zib.de/) 2017 instances can be loaded into a PySCIPOpt model using the `Loader` class.

```python
from geco.mips.miplib.base import Loader

instance = Loader().load_instance('INSTANCE_NAME.mps.gz')
```

## Implemented Generators

All the following instances are implemented following some of the generation techniques found in the literature, please
refer to the modules corresponding to the generating function for a reference to where it was introduced.
